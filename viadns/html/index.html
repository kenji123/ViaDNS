					<div>
						ViaDNS makes it seem like you are in the US by redirecting requests that services like Netflix and Hulu use to determine your device's current location.
						Unlike VPNs and Proxies that redirect all of your internet traffic and slow down your overall speed, ViaDNS only targets geolocation related traffic.
						Ensuring that you get the best speed possible out of your internet connection while streaming from these services.

					<div class="info-block-header">Is it safe?</div>
					<div>
						ViaDNS only looks at the URL of your requests, and doesn't capture or modify the data being sent.
						This is even more true with HTTPS traffic, as it is forwarded untouched and in no way decrypted at any point between you and the intended destination.
						So, short answer; yes.

					<div class="info-block-header">Setting it up</div>
					<div>
						Simply configure your DNS settings to the IP address that is provided on your dashboard after you've logged in.
						Setup guides for Mac OS X, Windows and Ubuntu are also provided from your dashboard.
